Creating a game with Unity using built in VR tools

(Name tbd)

# Dev Post 3/18/2024 - The start

With my previous experience in Unity I hope to make a fully functional Unity VR game that is a type of first-person tower defense game
<br> </br>
### Features
---
Current features that I want to have
- A VR first-person perspective 
- Waves of enemies to spawn 
- Dynamically allocated map
- Towers to defend against enemies
<br> </br>

## Week 1: Getting Familiar with Unity
Within week one I hope to get a first-person rig set up that could be piloted by a VR user.
